RIntro
======

This repository is intended to provide material for the Introduction to R session at the [Science to Data Science Summer School](http://www.s2ds.org/).

Aims of Session
---------------

- To Introduce the R environment for statistical analysis/modelling
- To Introduce some key concepts in statistical thinking

Pre-requisites
--------------

The session has been designed with a very broad range of participants in mind.   Accordingly it will be rather general - the aim of the repository was to provide some extension activities for people who already have a lot of R expertise.


I am working with R version 3.1.1

I have added the following libraries:
